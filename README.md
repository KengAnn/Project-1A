# Project-1A
NUS International Fintech Project-1A <br>
This is the final project for my NUS Fintech course. <br>
We are creating an app for the Self-storage and warehouse industry, allowing automation of virtual viewing, instant appointment and/or space booking via the app. <br>
For my part, I'm creating a frontends for lessee to make appointments to view the space. Separately, I'm also building for the CRUD interface for lessor to view, add, change and delete appointments.<br>
